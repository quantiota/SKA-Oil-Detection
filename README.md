# SKA-Oil-Detection
Entropy-based real-time oil detection using Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA). This framework applies unsupervised entropy learning to seismic waveform data to identify oil-bearing formations through regime transitions. Originally developed for financial markets, SKA is here adapted for subsurface exploration.
