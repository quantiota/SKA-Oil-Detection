# SKA-Oil-Detection

**Entropy-Based Real-Time Oil Detection with Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)**

This project applies the SKA learning framework to seismic waveform data for the detection of subsurface oil formations. SKA is an unsupervised, forward-only, entropy-driven learning model that tracks **informational regime changes** instead of fitting predefined labels.

By measuring how information evolves in the seismic signal, SKA detects transitions between geological layers—such as the boundary between rock and oil—through sharp shifts in entropy. This makes it an ideal tool for real-time exploration and subsurface analysis.

> SKA does not learn what the signal *is*, but how the information *changes*—that’s where true discovery lies.



**Features**
- Synthetic seismic stream generator with oil-layer simulation
